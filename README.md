## Professional Summary

I am a motivated and certified professional with over 4 years of experience in client engagement, project management, and incident response. I have a proven ability to grow and retain a portfolio of diverse accounts in B2B and B2C settings. 

Eager to pivot into a tech-driven career, I’ve become CompTIA Security+ certified and earned Google’s Cybersecurity Professional Certificate along with TryHackMe’s Security Engineer Path to demonstrate hands-on experience with today's most popular technologies such as Splunk, Metasploit, Wireshark, Tcpdump, and Nmap to name a few. I am also interested in the tools of the future and am actively pursuing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate while building projects with AWS services such as S3, EC2, CloudFront, Dynamodb, Lambda, Route53, IAM, API-Gateway, Amplify, and more.

I’m a determined problem-solver and a quick learner who is excited to bring my unique blend of business acumen and technical skills to a new role. I am confident that my experience and self-starter mentality will make me a valuable asset to your team!


## Objective

I am looking for the opportunity to solve new challenges and grow my career.
