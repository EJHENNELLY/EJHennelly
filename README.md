## Professional Summary

My name is EJ Hennelly and I am currently an Insurance Broker with 4 years of experience in the insurance and risk management industry. During my time in this industry, I've had the opportunity to consult a wide range of high-value customers and C-Suite executives to understand client challenges and priorities. I have used my knowledge of the industry and product offerings to deliver customer value by developing solutions, managing risk, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

My time as an insurance broker led to professional development in many areas that I believe will be useful in a career in cybersecurity such as risk assessment, risk management, problem-solving, regulatory and compliance, analytical thinking, collaboration, attention to detail, and clear communication. While I have enjoyed my time in the insurance industry, I have found it to be repetitive and mundane at times. My yearning for new challenges and career growth influenced me to begin my journey in cyber security. 

Recently, I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my interest in technology and cybersecurity. The knowledge and skills I learned through this certificate program have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. I am currently preparing to earn my CompTIA Security + certification. My ultimate goal is to become a security analyst. This role suits me because I am a self-starter who is eager to learn, with  experience collaborating with both in-person and virtual teams.

## Objective

I am looking forward to transitioning into the field of cybersecurity. 

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and on my own. The items included in this portfolio have provided insights into:
- Programming for cybersecurity tasks
- Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
- SIEM tools for cybersecurity
- Detecting and responding to incidents using an intrusion detection system
- Performing packet capture and analysis
- Gaining hands-on experience with Python, Linux, and SQL

Additionally, it has paved the way for me to pursue an entry-level role.
