## Professional Summary

I am a motivated and results-driven professional with over 4 years of experience in risk management and consultative client engagement. I am proficient in partnering with enterprise stakeholders to manage risk, achieve compliance, and implement actionable mitigation strategies. CompTIA Security+ certified, I have developed expertise in security frameworks (NIST 800, ISO 27001, SOC 2) and hands-on technical experience with SIEM tools and network monitoring and analysis. 

Throughout my career, I've honed the ability to lead consultative discussions with high-net-worth individuals and C-Suite executives to identify their vulnerabilities and priorities. I am adept at resolving complex challenges by combining technical expertise with exceptional communication and strategic planning skills.

I am looking for new challenges and career growth. I will bring a self-starter mindset, enthusiasm to learn, and a drive to solve complex problems to your team.


## Objective

I am looking forward to transitioning into the field of cybersecurity. 

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my Cybersecurity training and on my own. The items included in this portfolio have provided insights into:
- Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
- Performing security assessments and IT system/process audits
- Compliance and Risk Management
- SIEM tools for cybersecurity
- Programming for cybersecurity tasks
- Detecting and responding to incidents using an intrusion detection system
- Performing packet capture and analysis
- Gaining hands-on experience with Python, Linux, and SQL
