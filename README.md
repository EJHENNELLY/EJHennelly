## Professional Summary

My name is EJ Hennelly and I am currently an Insurance Broker with 4 years of experience in the insurance and risk management industry. During my time in this industry, I've had the opportunity to consult a wide range of high-value customers and C-Suite executives to understand client challenges and priorities. I have used my knowledge of the industry and product offerings to deliver customer value by developing solutions, managing risk, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

Recently, I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my interest in technology and cybersecurity. The knowledge and skills I learned through this certificate program have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a security analyst. This role suits me because I am a self-starter who is experienced in collaborating with both in-person and virtual teams. I have strong analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, and I am eager to learn. 

## Objective

My career journey has led me to develop a strong interest in cybersecurity, and I am now looking to transition into this field. 

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and on my own. The items  included in this portfolio have provided insights into:
- Programming for cybersecurity tasks
- Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
- SIEM tools for cybersecurity
- Detecting and responding to incidents using an intrusion detection system
- Performing packet capture and analysis
- Gaining hands-on experience with Python, Linux, and SQL

Additionally, it has paved the way for me to pursue an entry-level role.
